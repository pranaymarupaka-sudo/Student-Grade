# Student Grades Manager

## 📌 Project Overview
Student Grades Manager is a simple **console-based Java application** that allows users to input and manage student grades.  
It calculates the **average, highest, and lowest scores** and displays a clear **summary report** of all students.  

This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming concepts** and efficient data handling using **ArrayList** in Java.


## ✨ Features
- Input student names and grades  
- Store data using **ArrayList**  
- Calculate and display:  
  - Average grade  
  - Highest grade (with student name)  
  - Lowest grade (with student name)  
- Generate a **summary report** of all students  



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java (Core)  
- ArrayList for data storage  
- Console-based user interaction  


## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the project.  
2. Open the file `StudentGrade.java` in your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, or VS Code).  
3. Compile the program:
